/*### **isSubsequence**

Write a function called ***isSubsequence*** which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters

in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. In other words, the function

should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing. */

function isSubsequence(str1, str2) {
    let p1 = 0;
    let p2 = 0;

    while (p1 <= str1.length && p2 <= str2.length) {
        
    }
}
